#### bamazon application


This application runs based on the input of a user. Make sure to create your mySQL database and generate your password for the database prior to using this application. 

The application will provide a list of the items that is available in database. You can add/delete/modify the data in the database or add your own data by following the example of the mySQL seed file. 

As soon as you run the application an inventory of the stock will show on your terminal, see example below:

Once the user selects the item by ID number and the quantity value by inputing the numbers, if the item is in stock them the application will return the order plus the price times the quantity value and lets the user know the value of his/her order. See below for an example:

Finally, if the user inputs more than what is available in the inventory, then the app/system will return and insufficient stock message and will return the available stock. See below:
![insufficientstock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44211709/54251589-167ae900-451e-11e9-9179-6780bdf455ad.PNG)
